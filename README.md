Xcad-Ecad-Converter
===================
It is a two-way converter which converts Xcad and Ecad file formats.
 The sample files for the format are given as sample.xcad and sample.ecad. 
 I have tried to build this converter but calculations are left.
 
 Instructions to run it :- It will ask for the file names for input and output files. 
 You have to give only the file names without extensions. But make sure the file formats are as given in the sample files.
 
 
 Dependencies:-
 sudo apt-get install flex bison
 
 Commands to compile the program:-
 
 bash a.sh

./x_econv
